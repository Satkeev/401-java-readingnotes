###Java Type System
Java uses primitives such as int, boolean and reference types such
as Integer, Boolean. Every primitive type corresponds to a reference type.
The process of converting a primitive type to a reference one is called autoboxing,
the opposite process is called unboxing.
Arrays of the primitive types long and double consume more memory than their wrapper
classes Long and Double.

###What Is an Exception?
An exception is an event, which occurs during the execution of a program, that disrupts the normal
flow of the program's instructions.
