###What are Java Imports?

Java imports at the very beginning of code segment packages “java.util”, there are 
Classes called for example, “Date” and “Calendar”, and we want to use them in your any 
program.  The reason that we need to tell Java that we are going to use these Classes is fo
example:
import java.util.Calendar;
import java.util.Date;

Notice that the import statements at the top are gone, and we’ve now prefixed every Date and Calendar
reference with java.util. This is correct code and will compile just fine. But it’s a bit annoying to
have to write out the java.util every time you reference Date or Calendar. So this is why we have
import statements in Java.
